# CS5228 Kaggle Project: Should This Loan Be Approved Or Denied?
## Team: pandas
 
This project contains notebooks for CS5228 Kaggle project:

__utils.py__: Contains utility functions mainly used for data pre-processing purpose.

__data_visualization.ipynb__: This notebook contains steps to generate charts and plots to view the dataset.

__normalization.ipynb__: This notebook contains steps to apply different normalization techniques to the dataset and 
compare their validation accuracies.

__data_model_selection.ipynb__: This notebook contains steps to apply different pre-processing skills to the dataset 
and compare their validation accuracies with different classifiers. We select the 3 top performing dataset and 
classifier for further fine tuning.

__MLP_RNN_fit.ipynb__: This notebook contains steps to fit the dataset with neural networks (MLP / LSTM).

__gradient_boosting.ipynb__: This notebook contains steps to fine tune Gradient Boosting classifier.

__Adaboost.ipynb__: This notebook contains steps to fine tune Adaboost classifier with Decision Tree base estimator.

__Random Forest.ipynb__: This notebook contains steps to fine tune Random Forest classifier.

__vote.ipynb__: This notebook contains steps to perform majority voting on a list of candidate outputs.
